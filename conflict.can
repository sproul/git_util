         I am working on a git project where there is a development branch. I made PR based on development, called LlmInteraction_object. In the resulting codeline, when I run 'git branch' I get the following output:
        * LlmInteraction_object
          development
         Now I have finished my feature, but I cannot check it in because of git conflicts. List the steps I should follow to resolve the conflicts.


# 2 successes:
cd $gax
bx git.clone git@bitbucket.org:qwickrate/qwickanalytics_semi_structured_data.git development
cd $HOME/git/qwickanalytics_semi_structured_data
git branch
git checkout development
git pull origin development
git checkout $pr_name
git merge development
git pull origin $pr_name
# merged with my latest
git add .
git commit -m 'merge with dev'
git commit -m 'merge with dev, add debug objects'
git push origin $pr_name








Alternatively:
manually fix merge in file
git add                    src/main/resources/python/ai_extractor/llm.py
git commit                 src/main/resources/python/ai_extractor/llm.py -m 'resolve merge'
git rebase --continue
git push origin branch_name
