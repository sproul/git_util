Dropbox is a free file synchronization/backup service where you can backup, save and share files. One of the best things is, that you can use it as git remote server.

Here is an example on how to do it. To start, open a shell/terminal window and go to your project directory:

cd ~/Projects/MyNewProject
Then enter the following lines:

git init
echo > README
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
Go to your local Dropbox directory and create a new directory:

cd ~/Dropbox
mkdir Repositories
cd Repositories
After that create a git directory on Dropbox:

mkdir myNewProject.git
cd myNewProject.git
Then initialize a new git repository, go back to your local project and and link it to your Dropbox repository:

git init --bare
cd ~/Projects/MyNewProject
git remote add origin ~/Dropbox/Repositories/myNewProject.git
git push origin master
ThatÂ’s it. From there, you can just clone ~/Dropbox/Repositories/myNewProject.git that you have associated with your Dropbox account. Of course, you can also share this repository with other Dropbox users.
